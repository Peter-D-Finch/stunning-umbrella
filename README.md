This is a hobby project that has two goals
1) Reading data from the BSC blockchain using web3 protocol (and an https endpoint) 
2) Building statistical tools to analyze the data collected

Currently the program pulls data from Pancakeswap's "Prediction". I was curious to see if there was any correlation between which way people were betting the price would move and which way the price actually moved.
